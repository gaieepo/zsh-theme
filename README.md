# Install
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gaieepo/zsh-theme/master/install.sh -O install.sh && source install.sh
```
Run this to install `git`, `zsh`, `tmux`,and my theme.

# zsh-theme
My custom `zsh` theme, called `gmm-zsh`. This is based loosely on `af-magic` and `sunrise` from @oh-my-zsh.
Derived from gauravmm/zsh-theme.

# `.zshrc`
My `.zshrc` file, including some shortcuts for cygwin environments. Uses [zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen) as a plugin manager.
